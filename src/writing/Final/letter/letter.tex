\opening{To whom it may concern,} 

My name is Juan Jose Taborda-Nuñez am writing to express my keen interest in the position of Young Associate within the OECD's Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities.

I am a set to receive a B.Sc degree in Economics from a Universidad del Norte in Colombia, and I am currently nominated for a scientific merit award. Throughout my bachelor program, I have had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through various projects. These projects have allowed me to develop wide set of research-oriented skills, from research design and data analysis to programming, modeling and implementation. To give an example, my thesis focused on an unsupervised learning method to characterize industries in the Colombian manufacturing sector, I went all the way from designing the idea to coding the solution and implementing it on existing data.

I would also like to highlight my strong analytical thinking skills, which have helped me to identify crucial pieces of information for projects and gather multiple points of view for a well-informed conclusion. Additionally, my thinking process accounts for new ways of doing things when projects stall, this eventually allowed me to develop organization and teamwork skills. I can organize what we have and set goals to achieve what we need. I can set teams in motion if needed, or adapt to established deadlines and hierarchies.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with the OECD. As a leading organization in the field of development and international cooperation, with high-quality research and analysis. I am confident that my skills and experience would allow me to make meaningful contributions to the organization's research initiatives.

All things considered. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit the OECD and contribute to its ongoing research efforts. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
