Schumpeter's contention that the seeds of capitalism's decline were internal, and his equal and opposite hostility to centralist socialism have perplexed, engaged and infuriated readers since the book's first publication in 1943. By refusing to become an advocate for either position, Schumpeter was able both to make his own great and original contribution and to clear the way for a more balanced consideration of the most important social movements of his and our time. This Routledge Classics edition includes a new Introduction by one of the world’s leading economists, Joseph Stiglitz.},

To do so, we employ 25 series, some of them starting as far back as 1650 and powerful panel data stationarity tests that allow for endogenous multiple structural breaks. Results show that all the series are stationary after allowing for endogeneous multiple breaks. Test results on the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, which states that relative commodity prices follow a downward secular trend, are mixed but with a majority of series showing negative trends. We also make a .rst attempt at identifying the potential drivers of the structural breaks. We end by investigating the dynamics of the volatility of the 25 relative primary commodity prices also allowing for endogenous multiple breaks. We describe the often time-varying volatility in commodity prices and show that it has increased in recent years.},

In his answers, Schumpeter offers guidance to Third World politicians no less than First World businesspeople.In his substantial new introduction, John E. Elliott discusses the salient ideas of The Theory of Economic Development against the historical background of three great periods of economic thought in the last two decades.},

The theoretical starting point is evolutionary theory with its premise that firms in different technological regimes pursue different paths to innovation. Similar modes of behaviour are found in the two datasets, and they closely correspond to those found in earlier studies. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, however, the results show that industries are not at all uniform in terms of how firms innovate; in almost all four- or five-digit NACE industries, three or more different modes of innovation can be identified. This suggests that firms’ strategic differentiation or local search activities overcome pressures in the technological environment towards homogenous behaviour, at least in the short term.},

The analysis makes use of a rich dataset containing data on innovation and other economic characteristics of a large representative sample of Norwegian firms in manufacturing and service industries for the period 1998–2004. First, we decompose TFP growth into technical progress and efficiency changes by means of data envelopment analysis. We then estimate an empirical model that relates these two productivity components to the characteristics of technological regimes and a set of other firm-specific factors. The results indicate that: (i) TFP growth has mainly been achieved through technical progress, while technical efficiency has on average decreased; (ii) the characteristics of technological regimes are important determinants of firm-level productivity growth, but their impacts on technical progress are different from the effects on efficiency change; (iii) the estimated model works differently in the two Schumpeterian regimes. Technical progress has been more dynamic in Schumpeter Mark II industries, while efficiency change has been more important in Schumpeter Mark I markets.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the patterns of innovative activities at the technological and country levels, using patent data for 49 technological classes in six countries (USA, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy). It is shown that the patterns of innovative activities differ systematically across technological classes, but are remarkably similar across countries for each technological class. In particular, two groups of technological classes are identified: ‘Schumpeter Mark I’ and ‘Schumpeter Mark II’. In these two groups innovative activities are structured and organized in different ways. The first represents a widening pattern: concentration of innovative activities is low, innovators are of small economic size, stability in the ranking of innovators is low and entry of new innovators is high. The second represents a deepening pattern: concentration of innovative activities is higher than in the first group, innovators are of larger economic size, stability in the ranking of innovators is greater, and entry is lower. The former group comprises mechanical technologies and traditional sectors, while the latter includes chemicals and electronics. This result suggests that technology-related factors (such as technological regimes, defined in terms of conditions of opportunity, appropriability, cumulativeness and properties of the knowledge base) play a major role in determining the specific pattern of innovative activities of a technological class across countries. Within these constraints, country-specific factors introduce differences across countries in the pattern of innovative activities for a specific technological class. Finally, the relationships between the specific features of the patterns of innovative activities and international technological specialization are examined. Technological advantages appear in general to be linked to higher degrees of asymmetries among innovators, higher stability of the ranking of innovators, smaller economic size of the innovating firms and lower entry rates of new innovators. These relationships, however, are different in the two groups of technological classes. In Schumpeter Mark I (widening) technological classes, international technological specialization is associated with relatively higher degrees of asymmetries among innovators and entry of new innovators (as well as smaller firm size) while in Schumpeter II (deepening) technological classes, international technological specialization is linked to the existence of a stable but competitive core of persistent innovators.},

The data are drawn from the Production Statistics and the Business Register of manufacturing firms in The Netherlands and the second Community Innovation Survey. A classification of technological regimes that refines Pavitt's taxonomy is applied to the data. Our analysis is aimed at identifying the variables that are best able to discriminate between technological regimes for our Dutch case. We find that a mix of innovation related and market structure related variables account for most variability and broad differences across regimes; dynamic market structure variables account for an additional share of variability and finer differences across regimes. Overall, we conclude that the concept of technological regimes provides a useful framework that helps to shed further light on the relationship between innovation and market structure.},

This finding prompted a lively research agenda that: i) provided empirical characterizations of sectoral patterns of innovation by means of taxonomic exercises; ii) sought to interpret sectoral patterns of innovation as emerging properties of underlying selection and learning processes reflecting the structural properties of technical change at sectoral level (“technological regimes”). In this paper, we reconsider one of the landmark works on technological regimes (e.g., Breschi et al. 2000), reassess its findings, and perform a quasi-replication of their its exercise. Our conclusion is that the proposed distinction between Schumpeterian patterns of innovation (Mark I vs. Mark II) and their interpretation in terms of technological regimes has still the promise of yielding important insights concerning on the connection between inventive activities and industrial dynamics.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to describe and explain sectoral patterns of technical change as revealed by data on about 2000 significant innovations in Britain since 1945. Most technological knowledge turns out not to be “information” that is generally applicable and easily reproducible, but specific to firms and applications, cumulative in development and varied amongst sectors in source and direction. Innovating firms principally in electronics and chemicals, are relatively big, and they develop innovations over a wide range of specific product groups within their principal sector, but relatively few outside. Firms principally in mechanical and instrument engineering are relatively small and specialised, and they exist in symbiosis with large firms, in scale intensive sectors like metal manufacture and vehicles, who make a significant contribution to their own process technology. In textile firms, on the other hand. most process innovations come from suppliers. These characteristics and variations can be classified in a three part taxonomy based on firms: (1) supplier dominated; (2) production intensive; (3) science based. They can be explained by sources of technology, requirements of users, and possibilities for appropriation. This explanation has implications for our understanding of the sources and directions of technical change, firms' diversification behaviour, the dynamic relationship between technology and industrial structure, and the formation of technological skills and advantages at the level of the firm. the region and the country.},

	abstract = {Este estudio estima la tasa de contribución fiscal (TCF) y la tasa de tributación efectiva (TET) 
para los diferentes subsectores de la industria manufacturera entre 2008 y 2018. Los resultados 
indican que, por cada producto vendido en la industria, el 23\% del valor de la producción a 
precios del productor se destina al pago de impuestos. Esta relación es el triple para los sectores como tabaco (67\%), cervezas (59\%) y bebidas alcohólicas (44\%), los cuales están gravados con impuestos especiales, también denominados impuestos sobre consumos específicos. Cuando se analiza la contribución fiscal como porcentaje del precio final al consumidor, esta cifra se reduce a 11\% para la industria, aunque se mantiene elevada para los sectores de cervezas (33\%) y tabaco (22\%). De otra parte, encontramos que la TET de la industria manufacturera formal fue de alrededor de 61\% en promedio para 2018, porcentaje que se ha reducido ligeramente desde 2013 (67\%). Sin embargo, se evidencia una gran dispersión de este indicador entre sectores. Cuando se incluye en este cálculo todas las empresas manufactureras (formales e informales) la TET se reduce a 23\%, lo que sugiere que la evasión y elusión generada por la informalidad empresarial continúa siendo uno de los mayores obstáculos para el recaudo de 
impuestos en Colombia. Por último, se estiman los efectos multiplicadores de impuestos para 
cada subsector y se encuentra que, por cada peso pagado en impuestos en la industria en total, 
se genera un pago de 2.13 pesos adicionales de impuestos en el resto de la economía. Esta 
relación es particularmente alta para el sector de papel y cartón (3,3 pesos) y sustancias y 
productos químicos (2,9 pesos), dada la importancia de sus encadenamientos productivos con el resto de sectores.},

High opportunity ICT applications are characterised by high growth of patenting activity, high rate of entry of new innovators and high concentration of technological activity across firms. They also display a diversified knowledge base in terms of technological domains and actors involved. Conversely, low opportunity ICT applications are characterised by a lower growth and by a lower concentration of innovative activities across firms, as well as by a lower rate of entry of new innovators. Innovations in these ICT applications show less diversified knowledge sources and a higher degree of internal knowledge base.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes important changes in technological innovation in the upstream petroleum industry. It provides evidence that shifts in sectoral patterns of innovation over the petroleum industry's lifecycle from the 1970s up to 2005 were dependent on the dynamics of knowledge base complexity (KBC), a key dimension of an industry's technological regime. Accordingly, observed shifts in innovation patterns are understood to be the aggregated strategic response of industry innovators to changes in the technological regime. The article proposes a quantitative method for exploring KBC and Schumpeterian patterns of innovation, and interactions between the two at the industry level. As the industry evolved, its knowledge base moved to higher orders of complexity creating a shift in the Schumpeterian pattern of innovation. Increased KBC was found to alter Schumpeterian patterns from Mark I toward a ‘modified’ Mark II. Instead of coming predominantly from ‘traditional’ established oil operators, technological innovation was increasingly triggered by a new class of emergent integrated service companies – ‘second tier’ systems integrators of the upstream sector able to cope with increased KBC.},

It indicates that vigorous oligopolistic competition, particularly in high-tech industries, forces firms to keep innovating in order to survive. This leads them to internalize innovative activities rather than leaving them to independent inventors, and turns invention into an assembly-line process. The bulk of private R\&D spending is shown to come from a tiny number of very large firms. Yet the revolutionary breakthroughs continue to come predominantly from small entrepreneurial enterprises, with large industry providing streams of incremental improvements that also add up to major contributions. Moreover, these firms voluntarily disseminate much of their innovative technology widely and rapidly, both as a major revenue source and in exchange for complementary technological property of other firms, including direct competitors. This helps to internalize the externalities of innovation and speeds elimination of obsolete technology. Some policy implications for industrialized and developing countries are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The effect of competition on innovation incentives has been a controversial subject in economics since Joseph Schumpeter advanced the theory that competitive markets are not necessarily the most effective organizations to promote innovation. The incentive to innovate is the difference in profit that a firm can earn if it invests in research and development compared to what it would earn if it did not invest. The concept is straightforward, yet differences in market structure, the characteristics of innovations, and the dynamics of discovery lead to seemingly endless variations in the theoretical relationship between competition and expenditures on research and development or the outputs of research and development (R\&amp;D). This paper surveys the economic theory of innovation, focusing on market structure and its relationship to competition, the distinction between product and process innovations, and the role of exclusive and nonexclusive rights to innovation, and draws conclusions from the different models. Exclusive rights generally lead to greater innovation incentives in more competitive markets, while nonexclusive rights generally lead to the opposite conclusion, although there are important exceptions. The paper reviews the large literature on empirical studies of innovation and finds some support for the predictions of the theory.},

Kirzner provides at once a thorough critique of contemporary price theory, an essay on the theory of entrepreneurship, and an essay on the theory of competition. Competition and Entrepreneurship offers a new appraisal of quality competition, of selling effort, and of the fundamental weaknesses of contemporary welfare economics. Kirzner’s book establishes a theory of the market and the price system which differs from orthodox price theory. He sees orthodox price theory as explaining the configuration of prices and quantities that satisfied the conditions for equilibrium. Mr. Kirzner argues that "it is more useful to look to price theory to help understand how the decisions of individual participants in the market interact to generate the market forces which compel changes in prices, outputs, and methods of production and in the allocation of resources." Although Competition and Entrepreneurship is primarily concerned with the operation of the market economy, Kirzner’s insights can be applied to crucial aspects of centrally planned economic systems as well. In the analysis of these processes, Kirzner clearly shows that the rediscovery of the entrepreneur must emerge as a step of major importance.},

	abstract = {Corporate innovation is often argued to result from, and be encouraged by, market competition. The tradition is to test such arguments with market concentration data; firms with stronger control over their market can afford the long-run investment of R\&D. Network theory has broadened our understanding of how competition is a function of structure within and beyond a market. Producers earn high profit margins to the extent they are few and their customers and suppliers are many and disorganized. The first condition is measured by the traditional concentration ratio for a market. The second condition is measured by the network constraint of suppliers and customers. My purpose in this paper is to describe how our understanding of the market competition effect on innovation is enriched when the concentration measure of market competition tradition in economics is replaced with the network model of market competition now prevalent in sociology. Results indicate that markets facing competitive environments, in high constraint market positions, show greater R\&D intensity and faster rates of innovation than do industries facing less competitive pressure. These effects persist even with controls for technological opportunity and appropriability, in contrast to traditional models using only concentration data to measure competition.},

	abstract = {Looking at the years 1870-2016, this book analyses the reasons behind Colombias chronically slow economic growth. As a comparative economic history, it examines why Colombia has seen lower growth rates than countries with similar institutions, culture and colonial origins, such as Argentina in 1870-1914, Mexico in 1930-1980, and Chile from 1982 onwards. While Colombia's history has shown relative macroeconomic stability, it has also shown a limited capacity for integrating into the world economy and embracing technological breakthroughs compared to the rest of the world, including steam, mass production and Information Technology. This volume thus moves away from the long-held view that institutional path-dependence is the main determinant of differences in long-run economic growth across countries},
